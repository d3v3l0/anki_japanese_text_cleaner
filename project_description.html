This is a plugin for Anki that can help clean up Japanese text in the following ways:

<b>Clean unnecessary spaces</b>, while preserving those spaces that are necessary for indicating the start of a Japanese reading (as in the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684">Japanese Support plugin</a>).

&lt;b&gt; 一[いち]&lt;/b&gt;から 始[はじ]めましょう。
=&gt;
&lt;b&gt;一[いち]&lt;/b&gt;から 始[はじ]めましょう。

彼女[かのじょ]はイタリア 語[ご]が&lt;b&gt; できます&lt;/b&gt;。
=&gt;
彼女[かのじょ]はイタリア 語[ご]が&lt;b&gt;できます&lt;/b&gt;。

<b>Clean unnecessary furigana</b> from the beginning, end, or within individual readings within text.

別に[べつに]
=&gt;
別[べつ]に

世の中[よのなか]
=&gt;
世[よ]の 中[なか]

Both are designed to:
<ul>
<li>Properly handle text with multiples lines</li>
<li>Properly handle text with HTML markup by allowing HTML tags to pass through unchanged</li>
</ul>
In addition, there are some features to guard against accidental changes or bugs in the plugin:
<ul>
<li>A <code>Check</code> action logs all changes that would be made without taking any action.</li>
<li>A <code>Diff</code> action produces a colorful HTML diff highlighting in green what will been added and in red what will be removed for each note.</li>
<li>A 'Fix' action actually performs the changes.</li>
<li>Each batch of changes is recorded in the undo history within Anki.</li>
<li>A full change log is kept in a SQLite database within the plugin's local directory.  Recent changes can be viewed in the UI and the full history of changes can be exported to a CSV file.  This enables you to recover any previous values altered by the plugin.</li>
</ul>
Despite these safety features, it's a good idea to back up or export your collection before using this plugin just to be safe.

You can access the dialogs by clicking <em>Browse</em> to open the card browser and then clicking Edit -&gt; Japanese Text Cleaner.  The fixer dialgos require you to select some cards first.  These are the cards that will be checked.
